# Advent of Code 2023

## What is AoC?

In the words of it's creator, [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/):

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## What is this repo?

This repo is going to store all the code I write to solve the daily programming problems. This is in no means supposed to be considered a reference, I am just a junior developper so all code is provided as-is with no guarantees as to it's correctness. I will however try to stay disciplined and try to write legible, documentated and unit tested code. I'm lazy though so we'll see how long that lasts...
